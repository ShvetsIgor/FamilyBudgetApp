# FamilyBudgetApp - Claude Context

## Product Intent

`family.budget` should not feel like a category-admin app.

Primary UX:

- user writes an expense in chat
- app parses amount plus merchant/context
- app asks only when confidence is low
- supermarket and mixed purchases should naturally continue into split flow
- category management is secondary and should stay out of the main path

Core principle:

- **context is not category**
  `Dabbah`, `Shufersal`, `McDonald's` are merchant/context signals.
  Real categories stay semantic: groceries, bakery, home, fuel, coffee, and so on.

## Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 15 + App Router
- **Language:** TypeScript strict
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui + custom tokens
- **State:** Redux Toolkit
- **Backend:** Firebase Auth + Firestore + Storage
- **Charts:** Recharts
- **PWA:** `next-pwa`
- **Date utils:** `date-fns`
- **Tests:** Vitest

## Active Runtime Contract

- Active locales: `en`, `ru`
- Hebrew / RTL is intentionally paused and is not part of the active runtime guarantee
- `/home` is the main expense-entry path
- `/categories` is an advanced cleanup/library screen, not a primary navigation flow
- `/expenses` should present split purchases by merchant context when that context exists, while analytics still stay category-based
- Category reset is allowed to leave expense folders empty; expense-side library entities should only appear after explicit activation or explicit chat choice

## Dev Workflow

```bash
npm run dev
npm run lint
npm run build
npm test
```

Current verified baseline after the 2026-05-28 alignment pass:

- `npm run lint` - green
- `npm run build` - green
- `npm test` - `489/489` green

## Architecture That Matters

### 1. Two parsing layers exist on purpose

- Chat still uses `features/chat/parser/parse.ts` for dictionary/store parsing.
- The newer deterministic expense engine lives in `features/expenses/engine/*`.
- Current strategy is **alignment, not hard replacement**:
  chat and manual flows share saved history via `suggestionMemory`, even though the front parser is still the legacy chat parser.

### 2. Shared deterministic memory

`features/expenses/store/suggestionMemorySlice.ts` is the common memory layer for:

- merchant history
- recent category usage
- split combos
- tag associations
- merchant context stats

As of 2026-05-27, chat saves now feed this memory too, not only `FastExpenseEntry`.

### 3. Store profiles still exist

`storeProfiles` is a separate chat-facing memory keyed by `storeId`.

Use it for:

- known store clarify chips
- per-store probable category ordering in the chat UI

Do not confuse it with `suggestionMemory`:

- `storeProfiles` is chat-facing merchant memory by canonical store id
- `suggestionMemory` is the shared deterministic ranking memory across flows

### 4. Expense writes must stay batched

`features/expenses/services/expensesService.ts` batches:

- expense create plus `monthlyStats`
- expense edit plus old/new `monthlyStats` deltas
- expense delete plus `monthlyStats`

If you change the expense domain model, preserve this invariant.

### 5. Auth boundary

`src/store/store.ts` resets the Redux tree when auth becomes `null`.

Reason:

- without a full reset, slice `status === 'idle'` guards can leave stale user A data visible for user B

Do not remove this unless you replace it with a full session-boundary solution.

### 6. Local date keys

Use `shared/utils/dateKey.ts` for local `YYYY-MM-DD` keys.

This is the contract for:

- chat context daily calculations
- weekly summary ranges
- recurring notification dedupe
- store profile last-used markers

Avoid mixing local day keys with `toISOString().slice(0, 10)` in product logic.

### 7. Expense list presentation is intentionally split-aware

`features/expenses/utils/expensePresentation.ts` is the shared presentation layer for `/expenses`.

Rules:

- regular expenses are listed and filtered by semantic category
- split expenses with a known `storeGroup` are listed and filtered by merchant context instead
- this is a presentation rule only; `expense.categoryId` remains the analytics/statistics key

Do not move this concern into `expensesService` or mutate stored category ids just to satisfy list UI.

## Recent Alignment Pass (2026-05-27)

Implemented:

- chat category-sheet flow preserves `storeId/storeName/storeGroup/isTagLearning`
- chat saves update `suggestionMemory`, not only manual/numpad saves
- chat auto-saves refresh `storeProfiles` when store metadata exists
- expense create/edit/delete writes are batched with monthly stats
- recurring-generated expenses keep `isRecurring` aligned with `recurringId`
- Redux store resets on logout/auth-null
- local-day helper introduced and applied to weekly/recurring/store-profile paths
- `Categories` removed from primary desktop sidebar navigation
- split expenses in `/expenses` now show and filter by merchant context instead of the first split category
- chat split saves keep fallback category selection inside the chosen folder context instead of falling through to an unrelated global first category
- test baseline updated and back to green
- category reset now clears remote `storeProfiles` and learned keywords, not only local Redux memory
- expense reset switches the expense side into library-first mode, so preset expense folders do not silently re-seed on the next auth load
- chat clarify fallback can offer library folders even when no expense folders are active, and selecting one materializes that folder before continuing to split UI
- folder/category editors now show name-only preset library suggestions while typing; selecting a suggestion fills the label and preset metadata without activating hidden entities
- recurring form can create or reuse sections and categories inline, and recurring-generated expense deletion restores the linked template due date instead of leaving it advanced
- recurring templates now resolve a real category before save, so mark-paid and first-run generation do not silently stop on empty `categoryId`
- newly created recurring templates backfill their initial occurrence when the start date is today or earlier; if that occurrence cannot be written, the template is rolled back instead of persisting half-broken
- `/expenses` context filter chips pass the active locale through preset `storeGroup` fallback labels instead of defaulting those chips to English
- savings contribution comments are localized at render/save time, and recurring incomes persist a `recurring` tag for list presentation
- chat folder-clarify flow no longer auto-selects the first category inside the chosen folder; leftover category choice is explicit, while fully covered split rows can still save without a fake fallback
- empty folders created from chat no longer send `FastExpenseEntry` into a broken state; the flow opens with folder context intact and supports immediate inline category creation
- recurring payment setup is section-first in the UI: empty sections block saving and offer inline category creation instead of silently falling back to a random category
- split row clarification no longer exposes whole historical split combos as one-click inserts; split memory only raises previously used sections/categories higher in the normal picker
- category and folder icon color choices now use an expanded 28-color palette

## Known Gaps

- Split persistence is still one `Expense` document with `splits[]`.
  There is no separate `splitGroup` entity yet.
- Chat parser is still the legacy parser entrypoint.
  The newer expense engine influences the product through shared history and split memory, but does not fully replace `parseMessage` yet.
- Inline category/folder creation inside split flow is still separate from the final expense write.
  The expense/stat write path is atomic now; category/folder creation is not yet folded into one transaction boundary.
- Category presets and library are still larger than the ideal minimalist product vision.
- Recurring-expense deletion restores schedule state but does not delete the recurring template; if future UX should offer "delete occurrence vs delete template", that is still a separate product decision.
- Browser-based verification against local `localhost` may be blocked by Codex browser policy, so UI validation may need production/manual verification when that happens.

## Safe Guidance For Future Changes

- Prefer improving `/home` and split continuation before adding more category-admin UI.
- Keep deterministic ranking explainable. Avoid hidden heuristics when a transparent signal can be stored instead.
- If you touch `expensesService.ts`, rerun `npm run build` and `npm test`.
- If you add any new "today" or "this week" logic, use `dateKey.ts`.
- If you change logout/session behavior, verify cross-user state isolation explicitly.
- If you touch `/expenses` list rendering, keep `expensePresentation.ts` as the single source of truth for split-vs-category presentation.
